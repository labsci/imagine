    <p>TODO intro with overview of trips</p>

    <h3 class="text-center">Cedar Breaks National Monument</h3>
    <p>Gemma and Anil flew over from Cambridge to meet meet Kathy and Dave in Las Vegas, and then we akk drove north east towards Utah, and onto the Colorado Plateau. The first park we came to was Cedar Breaks National Monument, in Iron County, Utah. We grabbed our equipment and joined the Wildflower Walk through the alpine sections that run along the rim of the amphitheatre. During the walk Park Rangers identified and described all of the local flowers, plants and trees and noted that temperatures at the top of the plateau are gradually increasing, affecting the flora and fauna. After our picnic lunch we listened to the Geology Ranger talk, and captured footage of the amphitheatre before a huge storm rolled in.</p>

<p>Cedar Breaks was established as a National Monument in 1933, and is formed of a natural amphitheatre with multicoloured cliffs consisting of shale, limestone and sandstone. As with its sister park Bryce Canyon National Park, arches, windows and hoodoos are in abundance. Interestingly, there are no cedar trees here at all - it’s likely that settlers mistook the many juniper trees for cedar, and the name stuck.</p>

<dl class="row">
  <dt class="col-sm-3">Geology</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">Cedar Breaks is located at the top of the Grand Staircase, standing at over 10,000 feet above sea level. Compared to the Grand Canyon (1.8 billion years old) which forms the bottom of the staircase, it’s rather young at only 50-60 million years old. As with the whole area of the Colorado Plateau, the amphitheatre here was formed from a combination of processes: deposition, uplift and subsequent erosion.</dd>

  <dt class="col-sm-3">Deposition</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">60 million years ago, Cedar Breaks was a flat area of land that lay between a shallow sea to the east, and huge mountain ranges to the west. Shale, limestone and sandstone were deposited at the bottom of an ancient lake here (Lake Claron), together with trace amounts of iron. Deposition continued for ~25 million years, creating the vibrant layers of the Claron Formation (deep red, warm orange and dusky pink) capped with white tuff formed from settled volcanic ash ejected and blown 100 miles east from Nevada ~30 million years ago.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Uplift</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">Nearby tectonic activity continued, and ~20 million years ago subduction at the Hurricane Fault caused the Colorado Plateau to uplift and tilt, elevating Cedar Breaks by 8,000 feet. This uplift uncovered the compacted layers of sedimentary rock, fracturing them in places and exposing them to the elements.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Erosion</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">The Colorado River (along with other rivers) is responsible for creating canyons throughout the length of the Grand Staircase, but there are other forms of erosion that take place at the upper elevations. As with Bryce Canyon (not actually a “real” canyon), the different geologic formations visible at Cedar Breaks are formed by a combination of falling rain, freezing ice and gravity. Falling acid rain seeps into fissures in the rock formations and reacts with the calcium carbonate present in the layered Claron formation, and slowly dissolves the limestone, enlarging the gaps further. The temperature commonly drops below freezing, and this water turns to ice expanding the fracture further, then melts and erodes the rock as it follows gravity down. This repeated action of freeze-thaw forces the rocks to break and fracture further, creating fins, arches, hoodoos and windows.</dd>
