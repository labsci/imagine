    <h2 class="text-center">The 2018 Grand Staircase Trip</h2>

The field trip expedition was funded by a grant from the National Geographic Society, and the technology development was funded by the University of Cambridge. Kathy Ho and Dave Berry from the LABScI team at Stanford started the trip in their home state of California, with Anil Madhavapeddy and Gemma Gordon from Cambridge joining them in Nevada. This expedition during the summer of 2018 spanned the states of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona and Colorado, with the team visiting 15 National Parks, 16 National Monuments, a number of State Parks, Historic Sites, recognised Recreation Areas, and places of interest.

<h4>California</h4>
<dl class="row">
<dt class="col-sm-3">Devils Postpile National Monument</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">An unusual formation of columnar basalt located near Mammoth Mountain in eastern California. The monument also protects Rainbow Falls waterfall on the middle fork of the San Joaquin River.</dd>
<dt class="col-sm-3">Manzanar National Historic Site</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">One of 10 American internment camps where 110,000 Japanese Americans were held during World War II from 1942-1945. It is located at the foot of the Sierra Nevada in California. Manzanar translates as “apple orchard” in Spanish, and before the war was an area inhabited first by Native Americans, and later by European Americans.</dd>
<dt class="col-sm-3">Death Valley National Park</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">This park straddles the California and Nevada border, east of the Sierra Nevada. It is the largest National Park in the lower 48 states, and is the hottest, driest and lowest (in terms of sea level) park in the USA. It is known for its harsh desert environment, valleys, canyons and mountains, with 91% of the park designated wilderness area.</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Arizona</h4>
<dl class="row">
<dt class="col-sm-3">Grand Canyon National Park</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">The main feature of this park is the Grand Canyon, a gorge formed by the Colorado River after seismic activity uplifted the area known as the Colorado Plateau. The park is located in northwestern Arizona, and is the second most visited National Park in the USA.</dd>
<dt class="col-sm-3">Tuzigoot National Monument</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">This monument preserves a 3-story pueblo ruin containing 110 rooms, built above the Verde River floodplain in Arizona. Tuzigoot is Apache for “crooked water” and possibly refers to Pecks Lake nearby.</dd>
<dt class="col-sm-3">Montezuma Castle National Monument</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">Located in Camp Verde Arizona, this is neither a castle (in the traditional sense) nor related to the Aztec emperor Montezuma. It is a set of well-preserved dwellings built and used by the Sinagua people between 1100-1425 AD.</dd>
<dt class="col-sm-3">Walnut Canyon National Monument</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">This 600 feet deep canyon just southeast of Flagstaff, Arizona is known for the cliff dwellings built by the Sinagua people. Several species of walnut trees call the canyon home, and maintained trails provide access for tourists to view the dwellings up close.</dd>
<dt class="col-sm-3">Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">Sunset Crater Volcano is a cinder cone located just north of Flagstaff, Arizona. It erupted in 1085 AD, spewing lava and ash that caused the local Sinagua to abandon their settlements. The volcano is the youngest of the San Francisco Volcanic Field, and while it is considered extinct, other volcanoes in the string are active, with eruption in the future very likely.</dd>
<dt class="col-sm-3">Wupatki National Monument</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">Located near Flagstaff, Arizona, this monument is rich in Native American ruins, with settlements built by the Ancient Pueblo People (Cohonina, Kayenta Anasazi and Sinagua). Wupatki means “Tall House” in Hopi, and may refer to the largest structure on the site, a multi-story Sinagua pueblo dwelling comprising over 100 rooms.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Petrified Forest National Park</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">This National park straddles Navajo and Apache counties in northeastern Arizona, and is named for large accumulation of petrified wood. The south of the park is strewn with fallen trees from 225 million years ago deposited by streams flowing across the floodplain, buried quickly by sediment of the Chinle Formation, and later fossilised. The north of the park showcases eroded badlands: steep slopes deposited layers of sediment that have been extensively eroded by wind and water.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">This trading post in Arizona was built by John Lorenzo Hubbell to facilitate trade between the native Navajo people and settlers in the area. The Navajo people were forcibly relocated to New Mexico by the US government between 1864-1866 in what was called “The Long Walk of the Navajo”. The trading post represents a landmark in history after this period, where Navajo people on the newly-created reservation could sell their handmade products to ease the economic depression following the Long Walk.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Canyon de Chelly National Monument</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">This landscape in northeastern Arizona preserves the ruins of indigenous tribes ranging from Ancestral Puebloans to the Navajo. It encompasses three major canyons: de Chelly, del Muerto and Monument, all carved by streams in the Chuska Mountains. Canyon de Chelly is owned by the Navajo Tribal Trust of the Navajo Nation, and is the only National Park Service location cooperatively managed in this way. The most distinctive feature is Spider Rock, a 750 foot high sandstone spire at the junction of Canyon de Chelly and Monument Canyon.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Navajo National Monument</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">The monument is located in the northwest portion of the Navajo Nation in northern Arizona, and preserves 3 cliff dwellings of the Ancestral Puebloan People: Broken Pottery, Ledge House and Inscription House.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Pipe Spring National Monument</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">The water of Pipe Spring was crucial to the survival of the Ancestral Puebloans and Paiute Indians for 1,000 years. The Mormon missionary expedition of 1860s also settled here and started a large cattle ranching operation. The site details the human history of the area over time, acting primarily as a memorial to western pioneer life.</dd>

</dl>

<h4>Colorado</h4>
<dl class="row">
<dt class="col-sm-3">Canyon of the Ancients National Monument</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">Located just west of Pleasant View, Colorado, the site is managed by the Bureau of Land Management and contains the highest known density of archaeological sites (30,000) in the USA, with well-preserved evidence of native cultures. Examples include field houses, check dams, cliff dwellings, shrines, petroglyphs and agricultural fields.</dd>
<dt class="col-sm-3">Mesa Verde National Park</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">The park protects some of the best-preserved Ancestral Puebloan archaeological sites in the USA, including the well known Cliff Palace structures.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Hovenweep National Monument</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">Hovenweep actually covers land in both Colorado and Utah, and is known for the six groups of Ancestral Puebloan villages that were occupied until the 14th century. There is also evidence of occupation by hunter-gatherers from 6,000 BC-200 AD. The monument has also been designation as an International Dark Sky Park.</dd>

</dl>

<h4>Utah</h4>

<dl class="row">
  <dt class="col-sm-3">Natural Bridges National Monument</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">Located just northwest of the Four Corners boundary in Utah, this monument contains three natural bridges: Kachina, Owachomo and Sipapu, the thirteenth largest natural bridge in the world. Natural bridges are eroded by flowing streams or rivers in the base of a canyon, and will enlarge over time until they eventually collapse under their own weight.</dd>
</dl>

<h4<Nevada</h4>

<dl class="row">
  <dt class="col-sm-3">Valley of Fire State Park</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">This nature preservation area is located just south of Overton, Nevada</dd>

    <h3 class="text-center">Cedar Breaks National Monument</h3>
    <p>Gemma and Anil flew over from Cambridge to meet meet Kathy and Dave in Las Vegas, and then we akk drove north east towards Utah, and onto the Colorado Plateau. The first park we came to was Cedar Breaks National Monument, in Iron County, Utah. We grabbed our equipment and joined the Wildflower Walk through the alpine sections that run along the rim of the amphitheatre. During the walk Park Rangers identified and described all of the local flowers, plants and trees and noted that temperatures at the top of the plateau are gradually increasing, affecting the flora and fauna. After our picnic lunch we listened to the Geology Ranger talk, and captured footage of the amphitheatre before a huge storm rolled in.</p>

<p>Cedar Breaks was established as a National Monument in 1933, and is formed of a natural amphitheatre with multicoloured cliffs consisting of shale, limestone and sandstone. As with its sister park Bryce Canyon National Park, arches, windows and hoodoos are in abundance. Interestingly, there are no cedar trees here at all - it’s likely that settlers mistook the many juniper trees for cedar, and the name stuck.</p>

<dl class="row">
  <dt class="col-sm-3">Geology</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">Cedar Breaks is located at the top of the Grand Staircase, standing at over 10,000 feet above sea level. Compared to the Grand Canyon (1.8 billion years old) which forms the bottom of the staircase, it’s rather young at only 50-60 million years old. As with the whole area of the Colorado Plateau, the amphitheatre here was formed from a combination of processes: deposition, uplift and subsequent erosion.</dd>

  <dt class="col-sm-3">Deposition</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">60 million years ago, Cedar Breaks was a flat area of land that lay between a shallow sea to the east, and huge mountain ranges to the west. Shale, limestone and sandstone were deposited at the bottom of an ancient lake here (Lake Claron), together with trace amounts of iron. Deposition continued for ~25 million years, creating the vibrant layers of the Claron Formation (deep red, warm orange and dusky pink) capped with white tuff formed from settled volcanic ash ejected and blown 100 miles east from Nevada ~30 million years ago.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Uplift</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">Nearby tectonic activity continued, and ~20 million years ago subduction at the Hurricane Fault caused the Colorado Plateau to uplift and tilt, elevating Cedar Breaks by 8,000 feet. This uplift uncovered the compacted layers of sedimentary rock, fracturing them in places and exposing them to the elements.</dd>

<dt class="col-sm-3">Erosion</dt>
<dd class="col-sm-9">The Colorado River (along with other rivers) is responsible for creating canyons throughout the length of the Grand Staircase, but there are other forms of erosion that take place at the upper elevations. As with Bryce Canyon (not actually a “real” canyon), the different geologic formations visible at Cedar Breaks are formed by a combination of falling rain, freezing ice and gravity. Falling acid rain seeps into fissures in the rock formations and reacts with the calcium carbonate present in the layered Claron formation, and slowly dissolves the limestone, enlarging the gaps further. The temperature commonly drops below freezing, and this water turns to ice expanding the fracture further, then melts and erodes the rock as it follows gravity down. This repeated action of freeze-thaw forces the rocks to break and fracture further, creating fins, arches, hoodoos and windows.</dd>
